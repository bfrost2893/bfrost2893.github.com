My name is Bradley Frost. I am software developer temporarily residing
in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am also a student at the University
of Michigan. My interests are all over the board. I enjoy all things
from circuits and hardware programing to web development. When not
being productive, you can usually find me looking for a good hike in
the Bay or trying to get to the beach. Or watching Netflix 
(currently Star Trek: TOS).
